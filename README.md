==================================

Overview
--------

Welcome to the Space Y Launch Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze SpaceX's launch data using data science and machine learning techniques to inform the strategy for Space Y, a new competitor in the commercial space industry.

Project Objectives
------------------

*   📊 **Data Analysis**: Gather and analyze data from SpaceX launches.
*   🔮 **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a machine learning model to predict the success of first-stage landings.
*   💰 **Cost Analysis**: Enhance understanding of launch pricing and explore the impact of various mission parameters.

Key Features
------------

*   🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling/normalization.
*   ✨ **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on existing data (e.g., launch time, launch window duration).
*   🧠 **Model Selection**: Exploring various machine learning algorithms, including:
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Decision Trees
    *   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
*   ⚙️ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like GridSearchCV.

Results
-------

📈 **Model Performance**:

*   Logistic Regression: 75% accuracy
*   Decision Trees: 78% accuracy
*   Support Vector Machine (SVM): 83% accuracy
